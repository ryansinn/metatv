# MetaTV — Claude Code Project Guide

## What This Is

MetaTV is a Python/PyQt6 IPTV client. It connects to Xtream API providers, caches channel data in SQLite, and plays streams via mpv. The UI has a three-panel layout: sidebar (sources/favorites/history), channel list, and a details pane.

**Run it:** `./run.sh` or `venv/bin/python -m metatv`

**Data locations:**
- Config: `~/.config/metatv/config.yaml`
- Database: `~/.local/share/metatv/metatv.db`
- Logs: `~/.config/metatv/logs/`
- Image cache: `~/.cache/metatv/images/`

## Critical Rules

### Icons — always from Config, never hardcoded
Every icon, emoji, or symbol displayed in the UI must be defined as a field on `Config` (`metatv/core/config.py`) and referenced through it. This includes media-type icons, action icons (play, close, delete, hide), section header icons, folder/season indicators, status badges — everything. Never write a literal emoji or symbol string directly in widget or layout code.

```python
# Correct
rm_btn = QPushButton(self.config.close_icon)
section_icon = config.favorite_icon

# Wrong — hardcoded literals
rm_btn = QPushButton("×")
super().__init__("Favorites", "★", config, parent)
```

If you need an icon that doesn't exist in Config yet, add it there first, then reference it.

### Logging — always loguru, never stdlib
```python
from loguru import logger   # correct
import logging              # NEVER use this
```

### Database sessions — try/finally, never `with session`
`with session` only manages transactions, not cleanup. Always:
```python
session = self.db.get_session()
try:
    # ... use session ...
finally:
    session.close()
```

### SQLite + SQLAlchemy JSON — manual serialization only
SQLAlchemy's JSON column type has SQLite compatibility issues. Use:
```python
metadata.cast = json.dumps(result.cast)   # saving
cast = json.loads(metadata.cast) if metadata.cast else []  # loading
```

### Qt threading — signals only, never direct widget access from threads
Qt widgets are NOT thread-safe. Worker threads must emit signals; only the main thread updates widgets.
```python
class MyWidget(QWidget):
    data_ready = pyqtSignal(object)   # signal defined at class level

    def start_work(self):
        self.executor.submit(self._worker)

    def _worker(self):                 # runs in thread — NO widget access
        result = fetch()
        self.data_ready.emit(result)   # marshal to main thread

    def _on_data_ready(self, result):  # runs on main thread — safe
        self.label.setText(result)
```

### Signal blocking during UI state restoration
Block signals before programmatically setting state, connect signals after:
```python
for chip in self.chips:
    chip.blockSignals(True)
    chip.set_enabled(config.is_enabled(chip.type))
    chip.blockSignals(False)
for chip in self.chips:
    chip.toggled.connect(self.on_toggled)
```

### EPG notifications — never call NotificationManager from worker threads
`NotificationManager.show()` creates a `QTimer` for auto-dismiss and must only be called from the main thread. In `EpgManager`, all notification calls from `ThreadPoolExecutor` workers go through private signals (`_notify`, `_progress_update`, `_progress_done`, `_progress_error`) that Qt queues to the main thread automatically.

### EPG times — stored as UTC-naive, display as local
`EpgProgramDB.start_time` / `stop_time` are stored as UTC-naive datetimes (the XMLTV parser normalises all timestamps to UTC). For display, convert with:
```python
local = dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc).astimezone()  # → machine local tz
```
For arithmetic (remaining time, progress bars), compare UTC-naive against `_now_utc()` — no conversion needed.

### EPG concurrent fetches — one worker at a time
`EpgManager` uses `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)`. Running two XMLTV fetches concurrently causes SQLite `database is locked` errors because each fetch does a bulk-delete + bulk-insert. Providers are fetched sequentially; the second queues behind the first.

### UI state persistence — all sections must remember state
Every UI section (splitter size, collapse state, filter selections) must save to config and restore on startup. Pattern: save immediately on change, restore during `__init__`. See `DESIGN.md` for the full pattern.

## Metadata Provider Chain

Providers tried in priority order until sufficient data found:
1. `ProviderMetadataProvider` — extracts from Xtream `raw_data` (always try first, zero latency)
2. `TMDbProvider` — future Phase 2
3. `OMDbProvider` — future Phase 2

`MetadataResult.merge()` uses confidence scores (0.0–1.0) to prefer higher-quality data per field.

## Image Cache

MD5(url) as filename in `~/.cache/metatv/images/`. LRU cleanup at 500MB. Always load images async via `ImageCache.get_image_async()` + signals — never block the main thread.

## Coding Standards

- Python 3.11+ type hints on all function signatures
- Google-style docstrings on public APIs
- Imports: stdlib → third-party → local, separated by blank lines
- Keep files under 1000 lines; one class per file (helper classes excepted)
- Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for blocking I/O; use `asyncio` for async providers
- `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` for deferred main-thread execution
